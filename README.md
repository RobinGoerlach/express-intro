# express-intro

A beginner-friendly introduction to **Express.js** – the minimal and flexible Node.js web framework for building web applications and APIs.

---

## 🚀 **What is Express.js?**

Express.js is a lightweight and powerful framework for Node.js that simplifies server-side development. It enables you to:

- Build web servers quickly
- Define routes to handle HTTP requests
- Serve static files and APIs efficiently

---

## 📚 **What You'll Learn**

This repository introduces you to the fundamentals of Express.js:

1. Setting up an Express server
2. Handling routes (GET, POST, etc.)
3. Serving static files
4. Creating RESTful APIs

Each section includes simple, easy-to-understand examples for hands-on learning.

---

## 🛠️ **Requirements**

To follow along, you need:

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

You can check your versions using:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## 📦 **Setup Instructions**

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-intro.git
cd express-intro

npm init -y
npm install express
```

Run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 **Example Code**

Here’s how to set up a simple server:

**server.js**:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Express.js!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## 🌟 **Next Steps**

Explore the examples in this repository and build your own Express.js applications:

- Add routes for different HTTP methods
- Serve static files like HTML and images
- Connect to a database and build APIs
